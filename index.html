    <h1>leuk iets</h1>
    <p>Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
        Make it count, play it straight
        Don't look back, don't hesitate
        When you go big time
        What you want, what you feel
        Never quit, and make it real
        When you roll big time (oh-oh)
        Hey (oh), hey (oh)
        Listen to your heart now (eh)
        Hey (oh), hey (oh)
        Don't you feel the rush?
        Hey (oh), hey (oh)
        Better take your shot now
        Oh-oh, oh-oh (hey), oh-oh, oh-oh
        Go and shake it up, what you gotta lose?
        Go and make your luck with the life you choose
        If you want it all, lay it on the line
        It's the only life you got
        So you gotta live it big time
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
        Step it up, get in gear
        Go for broke, make it clear
        Gotta go big time (oh, hey)
        Make it work, get it right
        Change the world over night
        Gotta dream big time (oh-whoa)
        Hey (oh), hey (oh)
        Give it all you got now (eh)
        Hey (oh), hey (oh)
        Isn't it a rush?
        Hey (oh), hey (oh)
        Finish what you start now
        Oh-oh, oh-oh (hey), oh-oh, oh-oh (whoa)
        Go and shake it up, what you gotta lose?
        Go and make your luck with the life you choose (life you choose)
        If you want it all, lay it on the line
        It's the only life you got
        So you gotta live it big time
        Look around (uh)
        Every light is shining now
        It's brighter somehow (whoa)
        Look around
        Nothing's really as it seems
        Nothing but dreams
        You and I
        Gonna make a brand new sound
        Like we own this town (we own this town)
        We can fly
        Now our feet are off the ground
        We'll never look down
        Welcome to the big time (time)
        All the pretty people see you walking in the sunshine
        Welcome to the good times (times)
        Life will never be the same
        Go and shake it up, what you gotta lose?
        Go and make your luck with the life you choose (oh)
        If you want it all, lay it on the line
        It's the only life you got
        So you gotta live it big time
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
        If you want it all, lay it on the line
        It's the only life you got
        So you gotta live it big time</p>
